Title: Tools, Classes, and Methods for Interfacing with 'SaTScan'
        Stand-Alone Software
Description: 'SaTScan'(TM) <https://www.satscan.org> is software for finding regions in 
    Time, Space, or Time-Space that have excess risk, based on scan statistics, and 
	uses Monte Carlo hypothesis testing to generate P-values for these regions.  The 
	'rsatscan' package provides functions for writing R data frames in 
	'SaTScan'-readable formats, for setting 'SaTScan' parameters, for running 'SaTScan' in 
	the OS, and for reading the files that 'SaTScan' creates.
